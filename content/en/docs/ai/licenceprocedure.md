# AI model licence and provenance clearance procedure

Status: publication hold  
Last reviewed: 2026-08-02

## Purpose and current decision

This document defines how RawCull clears the DataComp CLIP, OpenAI CLIP, and
Meta SAM 3 model packs for public download. It covers technical provenance,
licence evidence, upstream contacts, questions to ask, acceptable answers, and
the final release gate.

No `.aar` model archive has been uploaded. Do not create a public GitHub
Release, publish a download manifest, or change a production descriptor to
`ready` until every model is either:

1. cleared under this procedure; or
2. deliberately excluded from the release and manifest.

The current AARs are unpublished development artifacts. The safest remedy for
the recorded provenance gaps is to create new release candidates from pinned,
hashed source files after the applicable licence has been cleared.

This is an engineering and evidence-preservation procedure, not legal advice.
For an unresolved interpretation, obtain advice from a qualified lawyer who
works with software copyright, open-source licensing, AI model weights, and
commercial distribution in Norway and the EEA.

## What “resolved” means

There are two independent gates.

### Provenance gate

RawCull must be able to demonstrate this complete chain:

```text
upstream owner and repository
        ↓
immutable revision and exact source-weight filename
        ↓
SHA-256 of the downloaded source file
        ↓
pinned conversion code, command, dependencies, and toolchain
        ↓
SHA-256 of the converted runtime model
        ↓
SHA-256 and byte size of the packaged AAR
```

A filename, a local cache timestamp, or a likely upstream snapshot is not a
cryptographic binding. Re-exporting from a deliberately selected and hashed
source is preferable to trying to infer the origin of an old conversion.

### Licence and distribution gate

RawCull must have a defensible basis for all of the following:

- the licence applies to the exact trained weight file, not only source code;
- conversion into an Apple Core AI model is allowed;
- the converted derivative can be redistributed to third parties;
- the intended distribution can be public and commercial, if RawCull is
  commercially distributed;
- all notices, agreement copies, acceptance steps, use restrictions, and
  attribution requirements have been implemented; and
- a gated source checkpoint may be redistributed through RawCull's proposed
  delivery mechanism, if applicable.

Silence, an unanswered ticket, a community member's assumption, widespread
third-party mirroring, or the technical ability to download a file does not
resolve this gate. Prefer a written response from the model owner or an
authorized representative. If that is unavailable, obtain a written opinion
from qualified counsel or omit the model.

## Current recorded evidence

The canonical records are:

- `ModelAssets/Notices/CLIP-DataComp/PROVENANCE.json`
- `ModelAssets/Notices/CLIP-OpenAI/PROVENANCE.json`
- `ModelAssets/Notices/SAM3/PROVENANCE.json`
- the licence and notice files beside each provenance record

The current relevant identifiers are:

| Pack | Upstream revision presently recorded | Source-weight evidence | Converted runtime SHA-256 | Open issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DataComp CLIP | `4afec35ffe57a943d569ff7ee888061830164da8` is a reference revision, not exporter-recorded proof | Exact selected file and SHA-256 are missing | `70b6a8b3502626dbfd4e228dff1e060e06606c93e7a19c8f260dba95b9a7d01e` | Rebuild from one explicitly selected upstream weight file and confirm its licence scope |
| OpenAI CLIP | Local cache snapshot `3d74acf9a28c67741b2f4f2ea7635f0aaf6f0268` | `pytorch_model.bin`, SHA-256 `a63082132ba4f97a80bea76823f544493bffa8082296d62d71581a4feff1576f`; not exporter-bound | `34b1c3f2eccfac50e5c47eeb33029b8c488fb7f3712d50d6d46965625a6a3798` | Confirm the exact weights' licence and rebuild from the pinned source |
| SAM 3 | Local cache snapshot `3c879f39826c281e95690f02c7821c4de09afae7` | `model.safetensors`, SHA-256 `6d06f0a5f84e435071fe6603e61d0b4cc7b40e0d39d487cfd4d67d8cc11cc14a`; not exporter-bound | `43a9b88e40d193f5a6608a7fee536a78f4ba4ec5d95f1eb24db03031630f0a31` | Confirm whether an ungated public derivative download is compatible with Meta's gated access flow, then rebuild |

These hashes identify current evidence; they do not themselves approve a
release.

## Common provenance remediation

Perform these steps separately for every model that passes its licence gate.

1. Choose one exact upstream repository, immutable commit, and source-weight
   file. Never use `main`, `latest`, an unpinned model alias, or an automatically
   changing download URL as the release input.
2. Download into a new, dated evidence directory. Preserve the upstream URL,
   immutable revision, filename, byte size, and SHA-256 before conversion.
3. Save the model card, licence or agreement, repository metadata, and any
   access terms as they appeared on the download date. Record their URLs and
   retrieval dates.
4. Record the converter repository and commit, Apple `coreai-models` commit,
   `coreai-core` version, Python environment or package lock, conversion
   command, macOS version, Xcode version, and conversion timestamp.
5. Run the conversion from that evidence directory. Do not allow the exporter
   to resolve or download a floating model identifier internally.
6. Hash the complete converted model directory with the established
   `directory-tree-sha256-v1` method and hash its runtime `main.mlirb` file.
7. Validate the converted model with the same PhotoAIKit checks used by
   RawCull.
8. Update the corresponding `PROVENANCE.json` with the actual source revision,
   source filename, source SHA-256, conversion command or record, tool versions,
   output fingerprints, and supporting evidence references.
9. Rebuild the AAR using the explicit selectors. Verify that the chosen runtime
   model, tokenizer, `metadata.json`, and complete notice catalog are present,
   and that `_source.aimodel` and conversion intermediates are absent.
10. Record the new AAR byte size and SHA-256. The previous unpublished AAR hash
    must not be reused for the rebuilt archive.

An example pinned Hugging Face acquisition has this form; select the correct
source filename before running it:

```sh
hf download OWNER/MODEL SOURCE_WEIGHT_FILE \
  --revision IMMUTABLE_COMMIT \
  --local-dir /path/to/private/release-evidence/MODEL/source

shasum -a 256 \
  /path/to/private/release-evidence/MODEL/source/SOURCE_WEIGHT_FILE
```

Keep raw correspondence, access tokens, account data, and legal advice out of
the public repository. Store them in private, access-controlled records. A
public provenance summary may record the response date, organization, scope,
and internal evidence-record identifier without publishing personal data or
privileged legal advice.

## DataComp CLIP clearance

### Current position

The pinned DataComp repository page identifies the checkpoint as MIT licensed,
which is positive evidence. The remaining technical problem is that the
existing exporter record does not identify and hash the exact source-weight
file it converted.

Official references:

- [Pinned DataComp checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-256x256-DataComp-s34B-b86K/tree/4afec35ffe57a943d569ff7ee888061830164da8)
- [OpenCLIP repository](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip)
- [LAION legal contact page](https://laion.ai/impressum/)

### Who to contact

1. Email LAION at `contact@laion.ai`. LAION publishes this address on its
   official legal contact page.
2. Open a discussion on the exact Hugging Face model repository so the question
   and any maintainer response are tied to that checkpoint.
3. If necessary, open an issue with the OpenCLIP maintainers to identify which
   upstream file the `datacomp_s34b_b86k` configuration resolves. OpenCLIP can
   help with technical identity; the model owner or counsel should resolve
   licence scope.

### Recorded LAION email request

On 2026-08-02 at 17:20 CEST, the RawCull maintainer emailed
`contact@laion.ai` with the subject “Written clarification requested for
DataComp CLIP weight licensing and redistribution.” The request identified:

- repository:
  `laion/CLIP-ViT-B-32-256x256-DataComp-s34B-b86K`;
- immutable revision:
  `4afec35ffe57a943d569ff7ee888061830164da8`;
- proposed source-weight file: `open_clip_model.safetensors`;
- model configuration: OpenCLIP `ViT-B-32-256` with
  `datacomp_s34b_b86k` weights;
- transformation: a float16 Apple Core AI runtime representation for local
  photo similarity and text-to-image semantic search; and
- delivery: an optional model archive downloaded by RawCull from a public
  GitHub Release, including possible use with a commercially distributed
  version of RawCull.

The email stated that RawCull has not publicly distributed the model or its
converted derivative and will not redistribute the DataComp training dataset.
It proposed preserving the source byte size and SHA-256 and including the
applicable MIT licence, copyright and attribution notices, model information,
provenance, and checksums with the archive.

LAION was asked to confirm whether the displayed MIT licence covers the exact
weight file, conversion into the proposed runtime representation, public and
commercial redistribution of the derivative, and whether any additional
DataComp, OpenCLIP, attribution, acceptable-use, or other conditions apply. The
request also asked whether the model card's “out of scope” deployment language
is safety guidance or an additional legal restriction.

Status: awaiting a substantive response from LAION or another person
authorized to clarify the rights applicable to the weights. Sending the email
does not clear the pack. Preserve the original message and any response in the
private evidence register; do not add the maintainer's personal email address
or complete mail headers to this public repository.

### Questions to ask

Identify the exact repository, revision, and proposed source file, then ask:

1. Is that exact trained weight file offered under the MIT licence shown on the
   model repository?
2. Does that permission cover conversion into another runtime representation
   and redistribution of the converted weights with a desktop application?
3. Is public and commercial redistribution permitted, provided the MIT notice
   is included?
4. Are any DataComp dataset terms, OpenCLIP terms, attribution requirements, or
   use restrictions additional to the displayed MIT licence applicable to the
   weight file?

### Required technical work

1. Select exactly one of the upstream weight files rather than leaving the
   exporter to resolve a model alias.
2. Download it at revision
   `4afec35ffe57a943d569ff7ee888061830164da8` and record its SHA-256 and byte
   size.
3. Re-export DataComp CLIP from that local file under the common procedure.
4. Replace the null source revision and source checksum in
   `ModelAssets/Notices/CLIP-DataComp/PROVENANCE.json`.

### Sufficient resolution

The pack may pass this gate when both conditions hold:

- the new conversion has a complete pinned-and-hashed provenance chain; and
- LAION or another demonstrably authorized model owner confirms the licence
  scope in writing, or qualified counsel concludes in writing that the
  repository's MIT designation and accompanying materials are sufficient for
  the intended distribution.

If the answer is negative or remains materially ambiguous, replace the model
with a checkpoint having explicit weight-level redistribution terms or omit
the DataComp pack.

## OpenAI CLIP clearance

### Current position

The OpenAI CLIP source repository contains an MIT licence covering the software
and associated documentation. The Hugging Face checkpoint currently lacks a
clear weight-level licence designation. A community discussion contains only
an assumption that the repository licence covers the weights; that assumption
is not authoritative evidence.

The model card also characterizes deployed uses as out of scope. Clarify
whether this is safety guidance or an enforceable distribution/use condition,
and independently assess RawCull's use, testing, limitations, and disclosures.

Official references:

- [CLIP model feedback form](https://forms.gle/Uv7afRH5dvY34ZEs9)

### Who to contact

1. Contact OpenAI Support using the chat control at `help.openai.com`. Ask that
   the request be routed to the team responsible for CLIP/open-source model
   licensing. Retain the ticket or conversation identifier.
2. Submit the same narrowly framed question through the feedback form linked by
   the official CLIP model card.
3. Open a model-specific discussion on the
   [Hugging Face Community page](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32/discussions)
   using its
   [New discussion](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32/discussions/new)
   action. This requires a Hugging Face login. Use a discussion rather than a
   pull request so the licensing question remains attached to the exact model
   distribution.
4. A response from an OpenAI employee or repository maintainer authorized to
   address the model's licence is preferred. An unsupported answer from another
   community member is not sufficient.

GitHub issue creation for `openai/CLIP` is currently restricted, so it should
not be the only planned contact route.

### Recorded support outcome and Hugging Face escalation

OpenAI Support declined to confirm or provide an authoritative interpretation
that the MIT licence in `openai/CLIP` applies to the pretrained weight files in
`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`. Support also declined to confirm that the
licence permits RawCull's intended commercial redistribution. The response
said that the applicable terms must be determined from the licence and notices
shipped with the exact code and weights being used.

This response does not clear the pack. Record the current conclusion as:

```text
CLIP source code: MIT licensed.
openai/clip-vit-base-patch32 pretrained weights: no explicit weight-specific
licence identified in the downloaded distribution, and OpenAI Support did not
confirm that the source-repository MIT licence applies.
Commercial redistribution: unresolved and blocked pending sufficient evidence.
```

The OpenAI Report Content form is intended for reports of potentially illegal
or policy-violating content. It is not evidence of permission and should not be
treated as the route for prospective licensing clearance. Support's recommended
next step was to ask the maintainers on the distribution source. For Hugging
Face, use the model-specific Community page linked above rather than the general
Hugging Face forum.

On 2026-08-02, the RawCull maintainer opened
[Hugging Face discussion #72](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-base-patch32/discussions/72),
“License applicable to pretrained CLIP ViT-B/32 weights,” asking the OpenAI
maintainers to identify the licence covering the hosted weights and to confirm
whether it permits commercial use and redistribution. The request also asks
the maintainers to add the applicable licence identifier or licence file to the
model repository. Opening the discussion records the escalation but does not
clear the pack; retain the response and assess the responder's authority and
the scope of any answer before changing the release decision.

Suggested discussion title:

```text
Licence applicable to pretrained CLIP ViT-B/32 weights
```

Suggested discussion body:

```text
Could the OpenAI maintainers clarify the licence applicable specifically to
the pretrained weight files in openai/clip-vit-base-patch32?

In particular, does OpenAI intend the MIT License from the official
openai/CLIP repository to cover the original ViT-B/32 checkpoint and the
converted weight files hosted here, including commercial use, conversion to
another runtime representation, and redistribution subject to the MIT
conditions?

If so, could you add the applicable licence identifier and/or LICENSE file to
this model repository so downstream users can establish a reliable licensing
record?
```

A maintainer comment may clarify intent, but the strongest resolution is a
licence file, model-card licence declaration, or written statement from the
rights holder that expressly covers the exact weights and proposed use. Until
then, do not approve commercial redistribution of this pack.

### Questions to ask

Provide this exact identity:

- repository: `openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`;
- revision: `3d74acf9a28c67741b2f4f2ea7635f0aaf6f0268`;
- file: `pytorch_model.bin`;
- SHA-256:
  `a63082132ba4f97a80bea76823f544493bffa8082296d62d71581a4feff1576f`.

Ask:

1. What licence governs this exact trained weight file?
2. Does the OpenAI CLIP MIT licence apply to it, or is there a separate licence
   or set of terms?
3. May RawCull convert the weights into an Apple Core AI representation and
   publicly redistribute that converted derivative as an optional desktop-app
   download, including in a commercial application?
4. Which copyright notice, attribution, model card, use limitation, or other
   terms must accompany the derivative?
5. Is the model card's statement that deployed uses are out of scope guidance,
   or does OpenAI intend it as a legal restriction on deployment or
   redistribution?

### Required technical work

After licence clearance, re-export from the exact local source file and
revision above. Record the conversion command and bind the new output to the
source SHA-256. Update the provenance record and rebuild the AAR.

### Sufficient resolution

The pack may pass this gate only with:

- an authoritative written statement identifying terms that permit the exact
  intended conversion and redistribution; or
- a written legal opinion accepting a clearly documented alternative basis.

A response that merely restates the code repository's MIT licence without
addressing the trained weights is not sufficient. If OpenAI does not answer or
the answer does not permit the proposed distribution, omit OpenAI CLIP or use a
replacement checkpoint with explicit weight-level terms.

## Meta SAM 3 clearance

### Current position

The SAM License dated November 19, 2025 defines the trained weights as SAM
Materials and grants rights to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, and create
derivatives. Distribution must remain under that agreement and a copy of the
agreement must accompany the materials. RawCull now packages the complete
agreement and requires acceptance of its verified text.

The separate unresolved question arises because Meta's official checkpoint is
gated. The model page requires a user to log in and share contact information,
and Meta's repository instructs users to request access and authenticate before
downloading. Hugging Face documents that a gated model's authors control
access. The licence text appears permissive about redistribution, but a public
GitHub download would let downstream users obtain the derivative without going
through Meta's upstream access flow.

Official references:

- [SAM 3 repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3)
- [SAM 3 checkpoint and access gate](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3)
- [SAM License](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3/blob/main/LICENSE)
- [Hugging Face gated-model documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated)
- [Meta Open Source contact](https://opensource.fb.com/legal/terms/)

### Who to contact

1. Email Meta Open Source at `opensource@meta.com`. Meta publishes this contact
   address on its official Open Source terms page. Ask that the request be
   routed to the SAM 3 model/licensing owner.
2. Open a narrowly scoped issue in `facebookresearch/sam3` and/or a discussion
   on `facebook/sam3`. Link the public question from the private email so the
   project team can answer in its preferred channel.
3. Contact Hugging Face only for clarification of how its gate operates.
   Hugging Face is the hosting platform; its support cannot substitute for
   permission or interpretation from Meta as the model owner.
4. If Meta does not give a clear response, obtain a written opinion from
   qualified counsel or omit SAM 3 from public hosting.

### Questions to ask Meta

Provide this exact identity and delivery proposal:

- repository: `facebook/sam3`;
- revision: `3c879f39826c281e95690f02c7821c4de09afae7`;
- file: `model.safetensors`;
- SHA-256:
  `6d06f0a5f84e435071fe6603e61d0b4cc7b40e0d39d487cfd4d67d8cc11cc14a`;
- transformation: float16 Apple Core AI derivative for local inference;
- delivery: optional RawCull Managed Background Asset from a public GitHub
  Release;
- licence handling: complete SAM License packaged with the derivative and
  explicit in-app acceptance tied to the licence-text SHA-256.

Ask:

1. Does section 1 of the SAM License permit this converted derivative to be
   distributed from a public, ungated GitHub Release?
2. Must every downstream RawCull user independently request access through
   Meta's Hugging Face gate before receiving the converted derivative?
3. If downstream gating is required, what information and approval must
   RawCull collect, and may RawCull technically administer that gate?
4. Is packaging the complete agreement and requiring verified in-app
   acceptance sufficient to distribute under the same agreement?
5. Are there additional attribution, branding, reporting, geographic, trade
   control, or prohibited-use measures RawCull must implement?
6. Does the answer apply to both free and commercial distribution of RawCull?

### Possible outcomes

**Meta confirms public ungated redistribution.** Preserve the response, comply
with every stated condition, re-export from the pinned source, update the
provenance record, and have counsel review any material ambiguity before
release.

**Meta requires each recipient to pass its gate.** Do not publish SAM 3 as a
public GitHub Release asset. Managed Background Assets with an anonymous public
origin will not reproduce individualized Hugging Face approval. Omit SAM 3 or
design a separate authenticated acquisition flow and review it independently.

**Meta declines, gives an unclear answer, or does not respond.** Keep SAM 3
blocked. Obtain a legal opinion or omit it. Do not treat the licence's general
redistribution wording as resolving a separately imposed access condition
without an accountable decision.

### Required technical work after clearance

Re-export from the recorded revision and `model.safetensors` SHA-256, recording
the complete conversion command and environment. Preserve the full SAM License
with the pack, maintain explicit acceptance against its checksum, and rebuild
the AAR. Re-check the official licence immediately before publication because
the agreement states that Meta may modify it.

## Contact-request template

Use a real name and reply-capable address. Do not send an archive, proprietary
source, access token, or confidential material unless the recipient requests it
through an appropriate channel.

```text
Subject: Written clarification requested for redistribution of [MODEL] in RawCull

Hello,

I maintain RawCull, a macOS photo-culling application:
https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RawCull

I have not published or uploaded the model derivative described below. I am
seeking written clarification before doing so.

Upstream repository: [URL]
Immutable revision: [COMMIT]
Source weight file: [FILENAME]
Source SHA-256: [SHA256]

RawCull converts this file to a float16 Apple Core AI model for local inference.
The proposed delivery is an optional Managed Background Asset downloaded from a
public GitHub Release. The archive will include the applicable complete licence,
notices, attribution, provenance, and checksums. [Describe explicit acceptance,
if applicable.] RawCull is [free/paid; choose the accurate description].

Please confirm:

1. Which licence or terms govern this exact trained weight file?
2. May it be converted into this runtime representation?
3. May the converted derivative be publicly redistributed in this manner,
   including as part of a commercial application if applicable?
4. What notices, acceptance flow, attribution, gating, use restrictions, or
   other conditions must RawCull implement?

I would appreciate a response from the model owner or a person authorized to
clarify its licensing and distribution conditions. If another team handles
this request, please route it or identify the correct contact.

Thank you,
[NAME]
[CONTACT DETAILS]
```

For SAM 3, append the six SAM-specific questions above. For OpenAI CLIP,
append the exact question about whether the MIT licence covers the trained
weights and whether the model card's deployment language is guidance or a
restriction. For DataComp, ask whether the repository's MIT designation covers
the exact selected file.

## When to involve a lawyer

Engage a Norwegian lawyer before publication if any of these apply:

- the model owner does not answer;
- the answer is informal, conditional, or ambiguous;
- a licence permits redistribution but an upstream gate suggests a different
  access policy;
- commercial use, downstream acceptance, trade controls, prohibited uses, or
  indemnification requires interpretation;
- the responder's authority to bind the rights holder is uncertain; or
- RawCull will distribute in multiple jurisdictions.

Look for counsel with experience in copyright, software and open-source
licensing, technology transactions, AI model weights, EEA law, and US/EU trade
controls. The
[Norwegian Bar Association member search](https://www.advokatforeningen.no/en/about-advokatforeningen/search-for-members/)
can verify professional membership. The Norwegian Industrial Property Office
also publishes guidance on
[choosing an IP adviser](https://www.patentstyret.no/en/intellectual-property/ip-advisor).

Give counsel a private evidence bundle containing:

- the exact model card and licence captured on the download date;
- upstream repository, revision, source filename, SHA-256, and download method;
- the conversion recipe and explanation of what the derivative contains;
- complete notice catalogs;
- every upstream response with message headers, dates, ticket IDs, and links;
- RawCull's intended countries, free or paid status, distribution channels,
  end-user flow, and licence-acceptance UI; and
- the proposed GitHub release and Managed Background Assets architecture.

Ask for a written conclusion for each model covering conversion,
redistribution, commercial use, notices, downstream terms, gating, and any
required technical controls. Keep privileged advice private. Record only the
resulting release decision and non-confidential obligations in the repository,
unless counsel approves broader disclosure.

## Evidence and decision record

Maintain a private register with at least these fields:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Model | Exact upstream owner and repository |
| Source identity | Immutable revision, filename, byte size, SHA-256 |
| Licence identity | Name/version, official URL, captured file SHA-256, retrieval date |
| Contact record | Organization, channel, date, ticket/issue ID, responder and stated authority |
| Permission scope | Conversion, derivative redistribution, public access, commercial use, territories |
| Conditions | Notices, attribution, acceptance, gating, use restrictions, trade controls |
| Legal review | Counsel, date, private matter/reference number, approved/blocked conclusion |
| Conversion | Script/commit, command, dependencies, toolchain, timestamp, output hashes |
| Pack | Explicit selector manifest, AAR byte size and SHA-256, notice verification |
| Decision | Ready, blocked, replaced, or omitted; responsible approver and date |

Do not mark a contact item complete merely because a message was sent. Record
the actual answer and whether it addresses the exact file and proposed delivery.

## Final release checklist

A pack can change from `blocked` to `ready` only when every applicable item is
complete:

- [ ] Exact upstream owner, repository, immutable revision, and source file are
      recorded.
- [ ] Source byte size and SHA-256 were computed before conversion.
- [ ] The licence is captured from an official source and its checksum is
      recorded.
- [ ] The licence demonstrably covers the trained weights and converted
      derivative.
- [ ] Public and commercial redistribution is permitted for RawCull's actual
      delivery model.
- [ ] Any gated-access question is answered by the owner or resolved by
      qualified counsel.
- [ ] All required notices, agreement copies, attribution, acceptance, and use
      controls are implemented.
- [ ] The model was re-exported from the pinned local source under a recorded
      command and environment.
- [ ] Converted output fingerprints and runtime hashes are recorded.
- [ ] PhotoAIKit validation passes.
- [ ] A new AAR was built with explicit selectors and inspected.
- [ ] The AAR byte size and SHA-256 are recorded.
- [ ] `PROVENANCE.json`, `NOTICE.md`, and the application catalogue agree.
- [ ] A responsible human has signed and dated the release decision.

If even one required item remains open, keep that pack blocked or omit it.

## Publication sequence after clearance

RawCull's current policy is to wait until all three model decisions are
resolved. A decision to omit or replace a model counts as resolution only when
it is documented and the omitted asset is absent from the manifest.

After the decisions are complete:

1. Re-export every approved model from its pinned and hashed source.
2. Update the notice catalogs and change only genuinely approved catalogue
   descriptors to `ready`.
3. Rebuild and inspect the AARs; record their new hashes and sizes.
4. Generate and inspect the self-hosted download manifest with a non-beta or
   corrected `ba-package` toolchain.
5. Create the dedicated `RawCull-AI-Models` release as a draft and upload only
